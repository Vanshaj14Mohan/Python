#Operator overloading
# eg-> + operators works differentely with different datatypes
print(1+2)#3
print(type(1))# shows class int

print("good" + "day")#concatenate
print(type("good"))# shows class string

print([1,2,3] + [4,5,6])#merge
print(type([1,2,3])) #shows class list
#So basically same operator is allowed to have different meaning acc to context..
